# Safety & Compliance Features

This document outlines the requirements and proposed architecture for implementing Safety & Compliance features in the Handyman Pro application, addressing issue #9.

## Overview

The Safety & Compliance module adds critical safety features to protect workers and clients, ensure regulatory compliance, and maintain high service standards. This includes incident reporting, emergency response capabilities, and background verification systems.

## Core Features

### 1. Incident Reporting

**Purpose**: Allow workers and clients to report safety incidents, accidents, or property damage during service delivery.

**Key Requirements**:
- Real-time incident reporting from mobile devices
- Photo and document attachment capabilities
- GPS location capture for incident sites
- Structured incident categorization and severity levels
- Automatic notification system for stakeholders
- Incident tracking and follow-up workflow

**User Roles**:
- **Workers**: Report workplace injuries, equipment failures, property damage
- **Clients**: Report safety concerns, property damage, service issues
- **Admins**: View, manage, and track all incidents; generate reports

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface Incident {
  id: string;
  reporterId: string;
  reporterRole: 'worker' | 'client';
  jobId?: string;
  type: 'injury' | 'property_damage' | 'equipment_failure' | 'safety_concern' | 'other';
  severity: 'low' | 'medium' | 'high' | 'critical';
  title: string;
  description: string;
  location: {
    address: string;
    lat?: number;
    lng?: number;
  };
  photos: string[];
  documents: string[];
  witnessInfo?: {
    name: string;
    contact: string;
    statement: string;
  };
  immediateActionTaken: string;
  status: 'reported' | 'investigating' | 'resolved' | 'closed';
  assignedInvestigator?: string;
  followUpNotes: string[];
  resolutionNotes?: string;
  createdAt: timestamp;
  updatedAt: timestamp;
}
```

### 2. Emergency Contact & SOS

**Purpose**: Provide workers with immediate access to emergency services and contacts during on-site work.

**Key Requirements**:
- One-touch emergency contact activation
- Automatic location sharing with emergency contacts
- Pre-configured emergency contact list
- Integration with job assignments for context
- Automated notifications to supervisors and clients
- Emergency check-in/check-out system

**User Roles**:
- **Workers**: Access emergency features during active jobs
- **Admins**: Configure emergency contacts and response procedures
- **Emergency Contacts**: Receive notifications and location data

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface EmergencyContact {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  email: string;
  relationship: 'supervisor' | 'family' | 'medical' | 'police' | 'fire' | 'other';
  isPrimary: boolean;
  isActive: boolean;
  responseTime?: number; // expected response time in minutes
}

interface EmergencyAlert {
  id: string;
  workerId: string;
  jobId?: string;
  type: 'sos' | 'medical' | 'safety' | 'check_in_overdue';
  location: {
    lat: number;
    lng: number;
    address: string;
    accuracy: number;
  };
  status: 'active' | 'responded' | 'resolved' | 'false_alarm';
  contactsNotified: string[];
  responseTime?: number;
  resolutionNotes?: string;
  createdAt: timestamp;
  resolvedAt?: timestamp;
}
```

### 3. Background Checks

**Purpose**: Integrate background verification system for worker onboarding and periodic re-verification.

**Key Requirements**:
- Integration with third-party background check providers
- Automated verification workflow for new workers
- Periodic re-verification scheduling
- Compliance tracking and reporting
- Secure storage of verification results
- Audit trail for all background check activities

**User Roles**:
- **Admins**: Initiate, review, and manage background checks
- **Workers**: Provide consent and required information
- **System**: Automated processing and compliance monitoring

**Data Structure**:
```typescript
interface BackgroundCheck {
  id: string;
  workerId: string;
  type: 'initial' | 'periodic' | 'incident_triggered';
  provider: string; // e.g., 'checkr', 'sterling', 'goodhire'
  status: 'pending' | 'in_progress' | 'completed' | 'failed' | 'expired';
  requestedAt: timestamp;
  completedAt?: timestamp;
  expiresAt?: timestamp;
  consent: {
    given: boolean;
    givenAt: timestamp;
    ipAddress: string;
  };
  checks: {
    criminal: 'clear' | 'review' | 'disqualifying' | 'pending';
    driving: 'clear' | 'review' | 'disqualifying' | 'pending' | 'not_required';
    identity: 'verified' | 'failed' | 'pending';
    references: 'clear' | 'review' | 'pending' | 'not_required';
  };
  notes: string[];
  reviewedBy?: string;
  reviewedAt?: timestamp;
  nextCheckDue?: timestamp;
}
```

## Architecture

### Database Schema Extensions

The following collections will be added to the existing Firestore database:

1. **incidents** - Store incident reports with full audit trail
2. **emergency_contacts** - Store emergency contact information per worker
3. **emergency_alerts** - Track active and historical emergency situations
4. **background_checks** - Manage background verification process and results

### Screen Components

#### Shared Components
- `IncidentReporting.tsx` - Incident reporting form and list view
- `IncidentDetail.tsx` - Detailed incident view and management

#### Worker-Specific
- `EmergencyContact.tsx` - Emergency SOS interface and check-in system
- `SafetyDashboard.tsx` - Worker safety overview and quick actions

#### Admin-Specific
- `BackgroundChecks.tsx` - Background check management interface
- `SafetyReports.tsx` - Safety analytics and compliance reporting
- `IncidentManagement.tsx` - Admin incident tracking and investigation

### Navigation Integration

Safety features will be integrated into the existing role-based navigation:

```typescript
// Admin Navigation
- Safety & Compliance
  - Incident Reports
  - Background Checks
  - Safety Analytics
  - Emergency Contacts Management

// Worker Navigation  
- Safety
  - Report Incident
  - Emergency Contact
  - Safety Check-in

// Client Navigation
- Support
  - Report Issue
  - Safety Concerns
```

### Security & Privacy

- **Data Encryption**: All sensitive data encrypted at rest and in transit
- **Access Controls**: Role-based access with granular permissions
- **Audit Logging**: Complete audit trail for all safety-related actions
- **Data Retention**: Compliance with local regulations for incident data retention
- **Privacy Protection**: Personal information handling per privacy policies

### Integration Points

#### Third-Party Services
- **Background Check Providers**: API integration with services like Checkr, Sterling
- **Emergency Services**: Integration with local emergency response systems
- **Mapping Services**: Enhanced location services for incident reporting
- **Notification Services**: SMS/email alerts for emergency situations

#### Existing App Features
- **User Management**: Leverage existing role-based user system
- **Job Management**: Link incidents and safety data to specific jobs
- **Notification System**: Extend existing push notification system
- **Photo Management**: Utilize existing image upload/storage system
